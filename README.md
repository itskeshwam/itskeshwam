Hey there! I'm Keshwam, the coding wizard with a penchant for Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a sprinkle of C. 🐍🔥 As an undergrad student in computer science, I'm all about creating software that's not just functional, but also eye-pleasing and fun! 😍🎉

With my creative coding spells, I'll craft clean and efficient code that's sure to impress. But that's not all! I believe in injecting humor and fun into everything I do, from witty comments in my code to cracking jokes during team meetings. 😄🎭

Ready to join me on a coding adventure? Drop me an email at pandeykeshwam1122@gmail.com and let's collaborate on some spellbinding projects together! Don't forget to check out my GitHub profile for a sneak peek at my coding magic. 🧙‍♂️✨ Looking forward to connecting with you! 🚀👩‍💻🔥
